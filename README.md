This repository contains two projects that I used for my students this year as class materials. One of them shows how to use SQL statements and the java.sql package to perform different types of queries. The other one demonstrates the use of basic Java Swing components such as JFrame, JButton, and JTable in IntelliJ.

I used them to introduce the basic concepts and provide a foundation so that the students can start working on their own projects independently. Students are supposed to put pieces together to create their own database applications. The code is intentionally not optimized, allowing students to take ownership and refine it during their individual project work.
